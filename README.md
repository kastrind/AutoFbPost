# AutoFbPost
A Processwire module that posts on behalf of a Facebook profile/page whenever a PW page is saved.

To work, this module requires a Facebook app ID and secret.

If a Facebook page ID is also provided, posts will be made on behalf of that Facebook page.

This module provides additional control over the posts:
- Templates: posts can take place only for pages with the defined templates 
- On/Off switch: specify a checkbox field that will not allow the post if checked
- Name, message, description, image: specify fields that comprise the contents of the post
